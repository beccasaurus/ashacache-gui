Ashacache
=========

This is a client library to [Ashacache.com][AC], a Ruby on Rails website
website that my buddy [Lance][LKW] is making for a school project

This gem is made up of three parts:
 * [ActiveResource][AR]-based Client Library
 * [Shoes][SHOES]-based Graphical User Interface
 * Command-line Interface

See also: [Ashacache Wiki][WIKI]


Installation

    $ sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
    $ sudo gem install remi-ashacache

To set your Ashacache.com username and password, edit ~/.ashacacherc

    USER = 'John Smith'
    PASS = 'mypassword'


Usage
-----

The command-line interface

### Notes

To get [active_resource][AR] working with [Shoes][SHOES], I had to edit my local Shoes rubygems.  I had to remove two lines (one in active_support, andother in [active_resource][AR]) that said:

    require 'cgi'

I'll try to fix this by adding cgi to the path ($:) manually
